# Numprose

A library that converts a sequence of numbers into a list of words.

## Why?

IP addresses are pretty hard to distinquish from one another.

It is easier for many people to remember names, or phrases that are funny or unusual.


## Getting started

1. Clone the repo
1. Install the requirements

    ```
    pip install requirements.txt
    ```
1. Encode an IP into a phrase:

    ```
    numprose 192.168.1.1
    ('192.168.1.1`, 'very tiny skipping cats')
    ```
